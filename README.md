▶️ How to Use This Repository

Each coding session folder is self-contained.

General workflow

1. Navigate to the desired session folder


2. Create and activate a virtual environment


3. Install dependencies if required


4. Follow the instructions in the session-specific README



Example

cd Session2_PATELMeet
python main.py --input data/sales_clean.csv
