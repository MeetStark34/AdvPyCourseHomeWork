# 🚀 Advanced Python Course — Coursework Repository 🐍

Welcome to my Advanced Python Course coursework repository 🎓
This repository contains all course material, organized in a clear and academic structure, including coding sessions, practical work, and reference PDFs.

The goal is to keep everything easy to navigate, well documented, and future proof for evaluations, reviews, and reuse.

## 📘 Coding Sessions Overview

### 🟢 Session 1 — CSV Sales Analysis (Procedural Python)

Focus

* Professional Python project setup
* Virtual environments (venv)
* Clean and maintainable folder structure
* CSV data loading using the standard library
* Handling dirty or invalid data defensively
* KPI computation using pure functions
* Command-line execution with arguments

Key Concepts

* Separation of I/O and business logic
* Reproducible environments
* Robust data parsing

Folder: Session1_PATELMeet/

---

### 🔵 Session 2 — OOP SalesDataset (Object-Oriented Programming)

Focus

* Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals
* Designing clean class-based APIs
* Managing dataset state using attributes
* Encapsulating logic inside methods
* Refactoring procedural code into OOP
* Full data lifecycle: load to compute to export

Key Concepts

* Classes and objects
* Attributes vs methods
* Encapsulation
* Defensive programming in OOP

Folder: Session2_PATELMeet/

---

## 📄 Sessions PDFs

Folder: Sessions_PDFs/

This folder contains:

* Lecture slides
* Course reference PDFs
* Supporting theoretical material

These documents are read-only references and complement the coding sessions.

---

## 🛠️ Travaux Pratiques (Practical Work)

Folder: Travaux_Pratiques/

This section contains:

* Hands-on practical exercises
* Applied assignments related to the course
* Additional practice material beyond the main sessions

Each practical may be independent or linked to a session topic.

---

## ▶️ How to Use This Repository

Each coding session folder is self-contained.

General workflow:

1. Navigate to the desired session folder
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies if required
4. Follow the instructions in the session specific README

Example:
```
cd Session2_PATELMeet
python main.py --input data/sales_clean.csv
```
---

## 🔮 Future Content

As the course progresses:

* New sessions will be added following the same structure
* PDFs and practicals will grow independently
* Documentation will remain consistent and structured

Design principles:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Independent execution
* Explicit documentation
* Progressive complexity
